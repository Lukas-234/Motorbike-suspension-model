# Motorbike-suspension-model
This is our group project on modelling the suspension system on a motorbike. With the aim of finding a spring coeffcient and damping coefficient that minimises vertical rider acceleration.

## Road data Extraction



## Simulation of Code
Download the neccessary xlsx files, and input them into the relevant folder which is being used to run the code. Then simply run the code


## Changing conditions
To add or remove roads, scroll to the relevant section of code (line ...) and remove or add as desired
To change parameters scroll to the relevant secrtion of the code(line..) and change as desired.
