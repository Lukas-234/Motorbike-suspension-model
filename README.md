## Need to include
A README (or text-type) file explaining: (i) What each file does, (ii) How to run
the code, (iii) Where the three required numerical methods are implemented
# Motorbike-suspension-model
This is our group project on modelling the suspension system on a motorbike. With the aim of finding a spring coeffcient and damping coefficient that minimises vertical rider acceleration.

## What does each file do:
The final code is the final code
The folder with the title: "Road Data" includes all the data that was used in the final code
All other folders are initial drafts of the code, sorted by the numerical method used

## Simulation of Code
Download the neccessary xlsx files, and input them into the relevant folder which is being used to run the code. Then simply run the code


## Changing conditions
To add or remove roads, scroll to the relevant section of code (line ...) and remove or add as desired
To change parameters scroll to the relevant secrtion of the code(line..) and change as desired. 


## How to obtain new road data:
1. Open google earth pro
2. Using the path tool on google earth create a path over a chosen road (to increase accuracy have as many points as possible on the road)
3. Save that path file as a kmz file
4. Go to this website:  https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/elevation
5. With the website above, save the lattitude, longitude, and altitude data as a text file
6. Open that text file in excel and save it as a .xlsx file
